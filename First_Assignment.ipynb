        " - Python is a high-level programming language widely used in Data Science for analyzing data, building models, and creating intelligent applications.\n",
        "It is popular because it has powerful libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow, which make data cleaning, visualization, and machine learning much easier. Python simple syntax, large community support, and ability to handle complex data tasks efficiently make it the first choice for data scientists."
